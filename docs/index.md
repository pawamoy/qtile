# Everything you need to know about Qtile

Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager written and configured
in Python. It's available both as an X11 window manager and also as
[a Wayland compositor][running-qtile-as-a-wayland-compositor].

This documentation is designed to help you [install](manual/install/index.md)
and [configure](manual/config/index.md) Qtile. Once it's up and running you'll
probably want to start adding your own [customisations](manual/hacking.md)
to have it running exactly the way you want.

You'll find a lot of what you need within these docs but, if you still have some
questions, you can find support in the following places:
